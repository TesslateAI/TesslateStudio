## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tesslatestudio.git
cd tesslatestudio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode with hot reload capabilities.

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- The application should work out of the box
- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt for running commands
- Default project location: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects`

#### macOS/Linux
- Use Terminal for running commands
- Default project location: `~/Documents/Projects`
- If you encounter EACCES permission errors:
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```plaintext
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.featherless.ai/v1
```

### ESLint Configuration

The project uses ESLint for code quality. To enable TypeScript support:

1. Install TypeScript dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

2. Follow the TypeScript integration guide in the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)

## Known Issues

- Mobile sidebar may require double-tap to close in some browsers
- Code editor performance may vary with large files
- Some AI models may have response latency
